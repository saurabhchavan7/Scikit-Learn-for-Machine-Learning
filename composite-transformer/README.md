# Composite Transformers in Machine Learning

Composite transformers are advanced tools in machine learning that enable the application of multiple transformations to data. These transformers are particularly useful for complex data preprocessing tasks, where various types of data require different handling methods. Below, we explore the concept of composite transformers and their types, including their specific functionalities and use cases.

## What is a Composite Transformer?

A composite transformer is a type of transformer that combines multiple individual transformers into a single coherent unit. This allows for the sequential or parallel application of different preprocessing steps to data, making it easier to manage complex data transformations in a structured and efficient manner.

## Types of Composite Transformers

### Pipeline

- **Definition:** A `Pipeline` is a sequential composite transformer that applies a series of transformations one after another. Each step in the pipeline is applied to the output of the previous step, resulting in a final transformed dataset.
- **Use Case:** Useful for tasks where eamch transformation depends on the output of the previous transformation. For instance, scaling features before applying dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to ensure that all features contribute equally.

### FeatureUnion

- **Definition:** A `FeatureUnion` applies multiple transformations in parallel to different subsets of features or to the entire dataset. The results of these transformations are then combined into a single feature set.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for scenarios where you need to apply different preprocessing steps to different types of features or data. For example, applying text-specific transformations (like word count and bag-of-words) to textual data, while applying other transformations (like one-hot encoding) to categorical data.

### ColumnTransformer

- **Definition:** A `ColumnTransformer` allows for the application of different transformers to different columns of the data. Each transformer is applied to a specific subset of columns, and the results are combined into a single dataset.
- **Use Case:** Useful when working with heterogeneous datasets where different types of columns require different preprocessing steps. For example, applying scaling to numerical columns, one-hot encoding to categorical columns, and text processing to textual columns.
